# rDNA Array Length is a Major Determinant of Replicative Lifespan in Yeast


This repo is to organize and maintain the code/files associated with the rDNA CN manuscript. We will provide a link to the published manuscript when it becomes available.

* Code used to generate the figures and analyze the data is located within the [figure_code](./figure_code) folder.
* Code used to estimate rDNA CN from whole genome sequencing of yeast strains is located within the [genomic_sequencing_pipeline](./genomic_sequencing_pipeline) folder.
* Computer vision models that were used to analyze timelapse images of aging yeast are located withing a submodule found in the [cv_models repository](https://github.com/calico/ylmcv).
* Images and data tables used to generate figures are located within the [data](./data) folder.


If you find any of this code/analysis useful in your own work, please cite the manuscript as:
